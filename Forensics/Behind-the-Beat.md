**_Decription:_**
Agents intercepted an audio file named message.mp3. It plays single tone, but we have intel that a flag might be tucked way in the metadata fields of the file. Can you inspect the file and uncover the flag?

# Steps
1. First, I downloaded the mp3 audio file

2. I listened to the audio but it was, like the description said, just a single tone

3. I decided to run a 'strings' command on the audio file to see more information about it

4. Thats when I uncovered the flag!
