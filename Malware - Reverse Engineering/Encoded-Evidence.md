# Encoded Evidence

**Value: 75**

**Description:**
We've intercepted a suspicious script file. It appears to be a placeholder for some kind of malware delivery mechanism, but the actual payload seems to be hosted somewhere else. Analysts believe a flag is hidden by this script. Can you locate and decode it?

# Steps
1. Download the attached file

2. Opening the file and reading it, showed a url https://pastebin.com/raw/eqkzMd2M

4. I ran that text through a base64 decoder and got the flag!

Flag: C1{n0_d3bug_n0_p4yn}
