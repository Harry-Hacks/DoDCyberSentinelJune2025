# Hardcoded Lies

**Value: 75**

**Description**
The malware sample doesnâ€™t appear to print anything useful. But our threat intel team believes it holds a hardcoded configuration string. Can you pull on some strings to retrieve it?

Note: This sample is not actual malware.

# Steps
1. This challenge was faily straight forward, as long as you read the description

2. My only real step in this challenge was to download the attachment and run a `strings` command on it and grep for C1

3. That produced the flag!

`strings hardcodedlies | grep C1`\
`C1{h4rdc0ded_but_0verlooked}`
