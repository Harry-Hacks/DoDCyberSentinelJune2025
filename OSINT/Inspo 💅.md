**_Decription:_**
We believe that the North Torbians are heavily influenced by North Korean developments and wish to match them. We have suspicions that Juche Jaguar will try to build out similar spaces to ones in these pictures. Can you find the coordinates of where these pictures were taken?

The flag is any valid decimal degree coordinate notation within a 500m radius of the building. The flag is in the following format: C1<XX.XXX, XX.XXX}

For example, the White House would be at decimal degree notion of 38.897, -77.036. The flag for the White House would be: C1138.897,-77.036}
Note that this flag is a regex match for any valid coordinate within the 500m radius.

# Steps
1. Attached was two images of Kim Jon-Un walking through a city (definitely in North Korea) and another picture of him inside a very futuristic room

2. My first step was to reverse image search the distinct looking bridge, hoping that would point me in the direction of where this picture was taken

3. That showed me a TikTok with the caption "Kim Jong Un Inspects Hwasong Area"

4. I then Googled Hwasong and found their Wikipedia page which showed the coordinates

Flag C1{39.096,125.777}

# Takeaways
Overall, reverse image search to the rescue again!
